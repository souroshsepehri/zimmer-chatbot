# TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE - Why Your Chatbot Isn't Showing

## Quick Tests:

### 1. Test Your Server
Run this Python script to test what your server is serving:
```bash
python test_server.py https://your-app.onrender.com
```

### 2. Check What You're Seeing
When you go to your Render URL, what do you see?
- JSON message like `{"message": "Persian Chatbot API is running"}`?
- Error page?
- Blank page?
- Something else?

### 3. Test the API Directly
Go to: `https://your-app.onrender.com/api/docs`
- Do you see the API documentation?
- Can you test the `/api/chat` endpoint?

### 4. Test with Simple HTML
I've created `simple_test.html` - you can:
1. Open it in your browser
2. Change the URL to your Render app
3. Test all endpoints

## Common Issues:

### Issue 1: Backend Only Running
**Symptom:** You see JSON instead of HTML
**Solution:** The chatbot interface is built into the backend, but it's not being served

### Issue 2: Import Error
**Symptom:** Server won't start
**Solution:** Check if all dependencies are installed

### Issue 3: Port Issues
**Symptom:** Connection refused
**Solution:** Make sure PORT environment variable is set

## Quick Fixes:

### Fix 1: Check Your Render URL
Make sure you're going to the right URL:
- `https://your-app-name.onrender.com/` (not `/api`)

### Fix 2: Check Server Logs
In Render dashboard, check the logs to see what's happening

### Fix 3: Test API First
Go to `https://your-app.onrender.com/api/docs` and test the chat endpoint
